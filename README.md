# Sass Class

Sass Class contains minor things that we tend to forget, mix up or always search on the official documentations. The idea behind this repository is to compile all-things-sass that is very mistakable, or the things developers tend to not use generally because they might not be aware about them.

Examples are included for most under utilized sass features that I came across, and what their post-processed css counterparts look like.
